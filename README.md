A tool designed to help tabletop roleplayers determine just how much of a challenge a given fight will be. 

This is mostly targeted at game masters, but players can use it as well. 

Currently, the rules engine is targeted at 3.5 Dungeons and Dragons because it exists under the Open Gaming License.
